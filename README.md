Joan Karstrom Portfolio

Hello! This is my project that I did to further develop my Front-End Development Skills to create a Nodejs program.

This was a really good way to use my visual UI/UX skills to make a pretty version of my resume. I used majority textscript to write everything out but I also used Tailwind css and a few react dictonaries for animations and symbols.

I integrated it to the cloud with Vercel and the rendered site can be found here:
